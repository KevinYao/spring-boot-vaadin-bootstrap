spring-boot-vaadin-bootstrap
=======================

# Not maintained anymore

Head over to http://start.spring.io/

## Description

Contains several example projects to bootstrap a Vaadin application using [gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle),
[spring-boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) and [vaadin4spring](https://github.com/peholmst/vaadin4spring)

The projects are missing several features like unit-test, logging and custom Vaadin-Themes. I plan to add them soon. Feel free to contribute. 

## Usage

Clone the repository and import the Porject into your IDE. To launch an example, simply run ./gradlew bootRun in the root of the example. An embedded Tomcat Server will be started and after a view seconds your application is accessible under http://localhost:8080

## Available modules

* spring-boot-vaadin-multi - contains a multi-module gradle project
* spring-boot-vaddin-quickstart - contains the same code as spring-boot-vaadin-multi but as a single gradle project
